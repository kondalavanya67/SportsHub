                                         SportsHub


Project Description 
 
SportsHub is a handy tool for all sports lovers or players of any level. The final deliverable of this project is to provide everything related to sports at one place. Some of the functionalities of this website are:

• Providing information like rules and objectives of a particular sport and a video explaining how the sport is played. 

• List the necessary equipment. 

• Scrape sources like Flipkart and Amazon and provide users with the prices of equipment for shopping.

• Display latest sports news. 

• Display sport stores and coaching centres based on the user’s location. 

• Filter reviews based on sentiment analysis. 
 
Background 

Currently there are not many websites related to sports and no websites with all the essential components required for a person to start with a sport. It will be hectic for a person to browse different sites for different requirements. 
 
Purpose 

To eliminate the tiresome job of visiting many websites to learn a sport and provide all requirements to learn a sport like information about sports, nearby coaching centres and prices of sports equipment etc.,  
 
Assumptions and Constraints 

• We haven’t selected many games due to lack of interest of people and lack of sources to learn that game. 

• We assume that all the data we collected is correct and relevant. 

• We assume that all the information provided by google maps is correct.  

 
Interface to external systems

• Shopping websites like Amazon and Flipkart.

• Google maps 

Functional Requirements

• Home page for users to see details of a sport (like rules, equipment and their costs, nearby sports store based on his location, etc). The user need not be logged in for viewing this information.

• New users can register and there will be a confirmation email sent to complete the registration process. 

• Users will be able to reset their password in case they forget it.

• The user will be able to view/change his profile details like email address, password, favourite sports, etc. 

• After login, the user can see latest sports news according to his preferences (he can set the sports he is interested to follow).

• There will be 2 types of users - normal users and admin. The admin is responsible for adding new sports to the website and modifying the information provided. Normal users can just view information provided and access features of the website (listed below). 

•The user will be able to see the rules and objectives of a particular sport/game and also a video demonstration.  

• The user will see nearby sports stores and training centres based on his location (will be marked on the Map). 

• The user will be able to see the prices of equipment of each sport obtained from websites such as Amazon and Flipkart.

• The user will be able to comment/express their opinion about a particular sport.

• The reviews will be classified as positive or negative based by using Sentiment Analysis.

• If there is a sport about which the user needs information which is not there in the website, he will be able to request the admin to add it. 

• There will be a page for each sport showing the le ends of the game.  

• Implement a chatbot which will be able to answer basic queries about the site. (Not sure of completion) 
 
Operational Requirements 
Security 

• The user’s password will be stored in an encrypted format and will never be revealed as plain text in the Database so that no one can view it. 

• Normal users will not have access to modify the information/content present in the website. This access strictly rests with the admin. 

• The user’s sport interests will strictly remain confidential. We will make sure that no one including admin will have access to this information. 

User Access 

• Users of the website will not be able to modify any information about the sports which is displayed. 
 
System Availability 

• The system will have an uptime of 99% 

Performance and Response time 

• The response time for search (searching for a specific game) and queries such as showing the sports equipment, displaying comments after they are posted will be reasonable and the user will not face noticeable delay.
